## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Submit their email address using an `input` field
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
	- The `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"Whoops! It looks like you forgot to add your email"*
	- The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Please provide a valid email address"*

### What I learned

This challenge made me discover the Regex : I faced some difficulties to find how to check the email adress, I needed to watch a tutorial.

### Useful resources

- [How to verify an email adress](https://docs.microsoft.com/fr-fr/dotnet/standard/base-types/how-to-verify-that-strings-are-in-valid-email-format#:~:text=Pour%20v%C3%A9rifier%20que%20l'adresse,de%20l'adresse%20de%20messagerie.) - This helped me a lot for the Regex
